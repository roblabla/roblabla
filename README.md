:wave: Ohayo! I'm roblabla, a developer interested in all things low-level, from kernel and driver development to real-time embedded systems.

Here's what I'm currently working on:

- [SunriseOS](https://github.com/sunriseos/sunriseos), a toy reimplementation of the Nintendo Horizon/NX kernel, and various associated kernel-dev experiments.
- [CM Helper](https://github.com/CM-Research-Squad/CM-Helper), a Linux/Gtk+ version of the Credit Mutuel banking app to run on the Librem 5.
- [steam_controller_custom_firmware](https://github.com/h1k421/steam_controller_custom_firmware), a reimplementation of the Steam Controller firmware.
